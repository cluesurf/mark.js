# Gematria in JavaScript

For Node.js, not the browser, as it requires a database basically to do across cultures.

Pass in an array of characters, which you can get with the _spread_ operator.

```js
const chinese = require('@lancejpollard/gematria.js/language/chinese')
const chars = [...string]
const arrayOfIntegers = gematria.mapLineCountModulo(chars)
```
